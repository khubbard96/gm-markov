The gist of it is teaching the basics of music and an instrument to members of the EAGLEs program on campus. The EAGLE program is a new program that gives differently abled college age students and students with special needs an opportunity to be involved in music education. The mentorship program is open to anyone with musical experience so you don’t have to be an Music Ed major to be a mentor. We are really needing help this year, and we would love to have as many mentors as possible. The EAGLEs are always so appreciative and enjoyable to work with, and it has been one of my favorite programs to be affiliated with at Auburn so far! So please consider joining us this semester! Have a wonderful day 😊\n\n“\n\nFrom Trace Johnson",

The history of H goes back to the early days of the Holy Roman Empire when the church was attempting to build a system of standardizing chant music. They wanted to give every note in their standard chant pitch class a name and, since there were 8 pitches in the group, they went up to H. Later, when tonal harmony came into vogue and assigning flats and sharps to pitches became the common system, German theorists elected to maintain the B/H distinction while applying the #/b to all other note letters.

Crown's high brass soloists are playing with an even, round sound with great consistency and an incredibly mature sensitivity to blend and pitch. They maintain an evenness of sound throughout the feature, even in moving passages, and demonstrate a firm command of their instruments. Bloo's high brass soloists are louder and have a flashier lick that's kind of badass, but you hear individual sounds sticking out throughout the feature (an issue compounded by the fact that they're micd and don't need to play loud in the first place) and the fast licks lack the momentum and continuity of the sustained passages. Crown's high brass feature has a polished, round section sound and Bloo's has 5 or 6 people that just have no fucking clue how to blend and make their whole section sound like a tin can full of bees. I think that assessment is fairly reflective of both hornlines as a whole. ",

Without thinking, I replied \"I'm from Auburn, Alabama\".\n\nGrowing up in a military family, we moved every two years so I never really had a place I could call \"home\". I have a place where I was born. I have a place where I have lived the longest. But I have never had a place that I felt connected with enough to say \"I'm from - - - -\" with complete sincerity. \n\nSo as I said that, I was kind of struck. I knew I felt very comfortable at Auburn and it was a place I loved, but until that moment I hadn't considered that I really do think of it as my home.\n\nAuburn is my home and always will be. Thank you guys for helping make Auburn my little slice of heaven. Looking forward to one last year at Home with you guys! \n\n- Scoobert ",

		"Hi, Phil Swift here with Flex Tape! The super-strong waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape!

We’ve logged temperature for some 200 years now and Internationally logged data from many countries. It’s getting hotter. Whether humans are causing it is a stupid debate.

Think back to your probationary class. Think back to your color nights. \nI hope each of you also finds time to look forward to what future you envision for Delta Psi and Sinfonia. Who do you want us to impact with music? Where do you want our impact felt? How do you want us to advance music? The future of Sinfonia is yours and ours to compose. \nThank you, each of you, my brothers for just that; being a brother to me. Thank you, also, for your fellowship in music. \nOn and Ever Upward!

We would easily throw out “this brother picked me up on night when I needed someone, that’s sacrifice” or “I helped someone study, that’s sacrificing my time.” \n\nTrue sacrifice that develops true brotherhood comes from the selfless act of not waiting for those opportunities to present themselves to you, rather you are selflessly seeking every single day ways you can use any effort for another human being / brother and how you can build them up. It shouldn’t come forced but rather come naturally. There is so much deeper meaning than just driving a brother home and spending time with people, but doing that CAN be true brotherly sacrifice if we put our minds towards the true meaning. ",

And the unified, periodized, willful degradation of our minds and bodies serves as a precient reminder of our mortality and shared fate. It brings us closer to one another as brothers, and closer to ourselves as Musicianly Men.

The statue is designed to where you have a bunch of notes that converge into one when looked at from a certain angle (correct me if I’m wrong). The point is that we have many people from many different backgrounds that come together to form one group, Sinfonia. \n\nAt the same time, harmony can be used with a double meaning: yes, harmony in music but also harmony as in many people working in harmony with one another. When we talk about harmony it is usually this more generic definition of the word, with the double meaning of harmony because of the music aspect. \n\nI don’t think it is oxymoronic to include these words if you include the context of how they matter specifically to our chapter.

Is that what you are, Tyler?  A communist mule?  I didn't think so.  \n\nThe reason I'm right, is because clearly the speaker was drawing a comparison between physically mutilating a mule, \"muletilation\" if you will, to stripping away stubborness in a man.

I don't remember the specific time.  Either way, my dad, free of his restrictive boots, was so fast he lapped the females.  The drill instructors present even thought he cheated, saying stuff like \"Davenport.  How the fuck are you up here so fast?\"  He ran like a 4:30 pace.  They just couldn't believe it.  \n\nSo now it is only logical I carry on his legacy.
